    <p>I honestly never really understood how people take shits in public. Like talk to your self about it real quickly. It not comfortable, it smells all the damn time, and weird ass adults come in grunting for no reason. Then you have the toliet paper issue, which dont get me started on that. I belive we should just remove public restrooms strait up.</p>
