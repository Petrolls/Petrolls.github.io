            What do you care what I think, anyway? I don’t even count, right?  I could disappear forever and it wouldn’t make any difference… I may as well not even exist at this school, remember? (he turns to Claire) And you… don’t like me anyway! God, you’re so pathetic! (furious) Don’t you ever… ever! Compare yourself to me!  Okay? You got everything, and I got s—! F—in’ Rapunzel, right? School would probably f—ing shut down if you didn’t show up!  “Queenie isn’t here!”
            I like those earrings Claire. Are those real diamonds, Claire? I bet they are… did you work, for the money for those earrings? Or did your daddy buy those? (Claire starts crying.) I bet he bought those for you!  I bet those are a Christmas gift! Right?  You know what I got for Christmas this year?  It was a banner f—in’ year at the old Bender family! I got a carton of cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me and said “Hey! Smoke up Johnny!” Okay, so go home’n cry to your daddy, don’t cry here, okay?
